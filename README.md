# KrunkMemes
An API to fetch Krunker Memes from `r/KrunkerIO`
# Currently not working as expected
I need to package the stuff, after that it should work

when it does work this should be its usage:-

```js
const Memes = require('ModuleName')
Memes.getMems('KrunkerIO') //console.log()s the stuff
```
